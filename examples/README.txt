PLEASE READ THIS TO UNDERSTAND THE EXAMPLES

There are two kinds of examples:

================
board - These examples are found in the StellarisWare/boards directory.
These examples come with project files ready to load and build with several
different toolchains, as well as prebuilt binaries for each toolchain.
These are complete applications that include all project files, startup code,
linker files, etc. that are needed to build and run an application.

You should start with the board examples when you are first learning about
the kits or StellarisWare or tools.

================
peripherals - These examples are found in the following location:

StellarisWare/examples/peripherals

The peripherals examples are short bits of code intended to demonstrate one
particular feature of a peripheral.  You can use these as guides to help you
understand how to configure and use a peripheral, and you can even cut and
paste these into your own application.  But they are not meant as complete
applications, and contain no project files or startup code or anything else
like that.  We do verify that the individual C files containing the example
code will compile and perform the intended function but do not mean for these
to be used as standalone example applications.
